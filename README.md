# Impact-of-Fuel-Prices-and-Metro-Fares-on-Public-Transport-Usage-in-Istanbul

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between fuel prices, metro fares, vehicle sales, and public transport usage in Istanbul over the years. By analyzing these factors, I aim to determine their impact on metro ridership trends, providing insights that policymakers can use to encourage public transportation usage.

## Motivation

As someone who lives in Istanbul and uses the metro regularly, I’ve always been curious about how different factors, like fuel prices and metro fares, affect public transportation usage. While I was in the Netherlands, I learned that when fuel prices rise, the government sometimes lowers public transport fares to encourage more people to use it. This made me wonder if similar trends exist in Istanbul. This study gives me a chance to analyze a real-world issue while improving my data analysis skills through visualization, statistical analysis, and modeling.

## Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis 1 (H₀₁): Fuel prices do not have a significant impact on metro ridership in Istanbul.
- Alternative Hypothesis 1 (H₁₁): Increases in fuel prices lead to higher metro ridership in Istanbul.
- Null Hypothesis 2 (H₀₂): Metro fare changes do not significantly affect metro ridership in Istanbul.
- Alternative Hypothesis 2 (H₁₂): Metro fare increases lead to lower metro ridership in Istanbul.
- Null Hypothesis 3 (H₀₃): Vehicle sales do not have a significant impact on metro ridership.
- Alternative Hypothesis 3 (H₁₃): Increases in vehicle sales lead to a decline in metro ridership as more people opt for private transportation.

## Data Sources
To conduct this analysis, the project will utilize:
- Metro Ridership Data: Monthly metro passenger counts and trip frequencies from official transport source IBB Metro Istanbul: "Yolcu Istatikleri".
- Fuel Price Data: Montlhly historical fuel prices in Turkey from Aytemiz "Arşiv Akaryakıt ve LPG Pompa Fiyatları" and from TPPD "GEÇMİŞ DÖNEM AKARYAKIT FİYATLARI".
- Metro Fare Data: Yearly metro ticket prices for full, student, and discounted categories from tuhim.ibb.gov.tr .
- Vehicle Sales Data: Monthly and yearly automobile vehicle sales in Turkey, sourced from official automotive market reports. (Otomotiv Distribütörleri ve Mobilite Derneği | ODMD)

## Planned Analysis
Once I have the data, I'll analyze how metro ridership changes in response to fuel price fluctuations, fare adjustments, and vehicle sales. Here’s how I plan to approach it:

- Looking for patterns in metro usage when fuel prices rise or fall.
- Comparing ridership in years with high and low fuel prices to see if people change their public transport habits.
- Examining whether an increase in car sales leads to a drop in metro usage.
- Using regression analysis to understand if fuel prices, metro fares, and vehicle sales have a predictable impact on metro ridership.
I’ll finalize the exact methods after reviewing the data to make sure it's complete and suitable for analysis.

## Expected Outcomes
- If fuel prices increase, metro ridership is expected to rise as people look for cost-effective alternatives to driving.
- If metro fares increase, ridership may decrease, especially among full-fare passengers, while students and discounted fare users might be less affected.
- If car sales rise, metro usage may decline, indicating a shift toward private vehicle ownership.
- The combined effect of fuel prices, metro fares, and car sales could reveal key trends in transportation choices over time.
